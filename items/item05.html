		Latest On Kawasaki Z650
		The Kawasaki Z650 has been launched in India and has been priced at Rs 5.19 lakh (ex-showroom, Delhi). The new motorcycle is the replacement for the Kawasaki ER-6n, which was, in our books, among the most practical performance motorcycles on sale in India. With the Z650, Kawasaki has addressed the biggest flaw with the ER-6n - its ugly styling. The Z650 adopts cleaner and sharper lines which endows the new motorcycle with sportiness. Another noticeable difference on the new Z650 is that the bike weighs a massive 19kg lesser in comparison to the ER-6n.

		Kawasaki have endowed the new motorcycle with a trellis frame which has been instrumental in reducing the kerb weight. The Japanese two-wheeler giant also claims that the new chassis has improved the handling dynamics of the motorcycle. Powering the new Kawasaki Z650 is a liquid-cooled parallel-twin motor churning out 68PS, which is a drop of 4PS in comparison to its predecessor, but the new mill is Euro 4 emission norms-compliant. Performance of the bike shouldnâ€™t be affected as the drop in power is countered by the weight reduction. 
		The new motorcycle also gets equipped with slipper clutch and the saddle height is now lower at 790mm. Braking responsibilities are handled by twin disc brakes at the front and a single disc unit at the back, while ABS is standard. The Kawasaki Z650 will compete against the Benelli TNT600i.
